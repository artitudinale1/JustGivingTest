For this test I used:
http://yeoman.io/ - installing bootstrap & modernizr
Jquery 
Jquery-ui to style pop window
AngularJS
Firebase as backend. Donations data are store at https://jgivetest.firebaseio.com/. 
If you want to check the data, login dateils are : alex.garulli@gmail.com  - psw: javascript123


Test online at http://artitudinale.org.uk/JustGivingTest/app/ - usrn : alex - psw: jstest
It'd work from I9 + . In a IE8 AngularJS and Firebase do not work, I know it's possible but didn't figure out yet!
