#<b>Just Giving Recruitment-Test-Javascript </b>#

##<b>BRIEF/BACKGOUND PROJECT</b>##

This is my answer for the Recruitment-Test @ https://github.com/JustGiving/Recruitment-Test-Javascript.

I'm not familiar with ASP.NET MVC, so donations data are, in my answer, stored on Firebase. 

##<b>DESCRIPTION</b>##

###Story 1###

As a donor
When I go to the donation page

I want to be presented with a donation prompt with the ability to choose how much money I would like to donate.

###Story 2###

As a donor
When I go to the donation page

I would like to see the amount of people who have already donated to this cause.

###Story 3###

As a donor
When I click on the “Donate with JustGiving” button

The donation amount I have entered will be sent to the server and stored using the donation service.
